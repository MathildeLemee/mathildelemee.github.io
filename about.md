As a developer, I try to share what I know and keep on learning and improving my skills by reading books, blogs and attending conferences. I specially focus on improving software quality, testing best practices and building scalable systems.

I enjoy discovering and sharing with my team new tools and methods. I have been speaker at several conferences, mostly about testing frameworks and distributed caching systems and I am the author of several software projects, namely FluentLenium : an open-source framework to help people write Selenium tests

Iâ€™m also a founder of two companies, one mobile app, [SoFizz](http://www.sofizz.fr), to help women to find partners to share activities with (sport, restaurant ...) and another educative game studio, named Aetys.
